	<h1>Week 4 Assignment: Final Assignment</h1>

	<p>In which Hugh Barnes hopefully fulfills course requirements for Weeks 4-5 in <em class="title course">Introduction to SVG October 2010</em>. His <a href="http://github.com/hughbris/svg-course">incremental deliberations</a> can be observed and followed on Github.</p>

		<h2>Part 1: SMIL animation</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Develop an SVG document which has a small SMIL animation of any sort (changing the geometry or size of an ellipse, or changing the blur of a bitmap, or changing the clip-path applied to a colorful collage of rectangles). After the animation runs some fixed number of iterations (you can choose a number n between 1 and 6, depending on what seems "best" to you, and set repeatCount equal to n) then it terminates. At that time it activates a script that changes the color(s) of some feature (and perhaps other aspects) of your content (either randomly or deterministically) and restarts the animation.</p>

		<div class="response">
			<p class="lead-in">It's a little embarrassing that I went for about the most basic animation allowed by the instructions because of time constraints. Doing style with CSS, as I did originally, made the Javascript property setting a little tricky, so I reverted to an inline attribute. Oh well:

		<h2>Part 2: Interesting SVG examples</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Find three interesting examples of the usage of SVG on the Web. Offer a brief description of each and their URL. Let me know if I can share your recommendations with others.</p>
		<div class="response">
			<p class="lead-in">Feel free to share these examples. They are all examples I discovered before commencing the course:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h3>OpenStreetMap's <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmarender">Osmarender</a></h3>
					<p>This is not rendered as SVG, but rather uses SVG to create maps from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) data, and creates rasterised tiles for serving to the browser (using an interesting <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tiles@home">distributed processing</a> system like SETI@home). I have actually hacked on Osmarender a little myself. I don't particularly like the way the XSLT takes the rule file as input rather than the data, and would like to refactor it to use a more natural input (like the, er, map data). The project inspired me to look into what else might be done with SVG and maps, particularly interactivity, and lead me to the next examples. I find it interesting that there is a <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmarender/BezierCurves">debate about when to render curves as beziers</a>, and how to declare preferences.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><a href="http://www.carto.net/williams/yosemite/index.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Yosemite National Park - Interactive Hiking Map</a></h3>
					<p>This the sort of place I hope Osmarender might get to in the browser without post-rasterising. It's an amazingly inspiring interactive map of Yosemite National Park. I'm not quite sure from where it's sourcing its geocoordinates (there's a <a href="http://www.svgopen.org/2005/papers/abstract_williams_yosemite_national_park/index.html">paper written about it</a>, so with more time I can find out), but I can see the park boundary hardcoded as an svg path.</p>
					<p>I particularly like the "Animate Trail!" link  in the trails tab, which cleverly degrades to "Show Trail!" on Firfox, which doesn't support animation. Calculating the profile adjacent to this link is just brilliant and I can imagine vetry important. Wow!</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3><a href="http://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg" type="image/svg+xml">Mozilla SVG Tetris</a></h3>
					<p>This is the old Tetris game implemented in SVG. It gets by without declarative animation (<a href="http://www.xul.fr/svgtetris.svg.txt" type="text/plain">source</a>), so works in just about any static SVG-supporting browser platform. Using Javascript timers and event listers to reposition the tiles also means we get the retro jerkiness of movement that the classic version had. I daresay a declaratively animated version would have produced quite smooth movements. In fact it's almost completely implemented with Javascript, with only three SVG elements after <code>&lt;script/></code>, two of which are near-empty group elements (<code>&lt;g/></code>) acting as scaffold.</p>
					<p>It's curious that something implemented in Javascript, undoubtedly less accessible in theory, is in practice able to be appreciated in full fuctionality by a greater audience because of incomplete SVG standards support.</p>

		<h2>Part 3(B): Practical SVG</h2>
		<div class="challenge">
			<p class="lead-in">Use SVG to illustrate some data (textual or numeric) that has been:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>provided from a web site,</li>
				<li>(or) contained in an XML or plaintext document on a server</li>
				<li>(or) bundled as an array or other JavaScript object into your SVG document.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Consider using any of the conventional ways of that illustrating data (charts, figures, graphs, maps. etc.) or consider more experimental ways of visualizing data such as shown in the work of Edward Tufte or in some of the illustrations of similarity using OWL. Hopefully, your illustration will help guide insights about the data that might not be apparent to someone just looking at the raw textual or numeric data.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="response">
			<p>Well, this is just extremely lame and disappointing, I won't even talk it up. I have been tweaking this for a long time with very little progress. Many ideas, but barely got past first base. It's quite difficult without a decent DOM inspector (I know Opera has one, but that's not possible where I do most of my editing).</p>
			<p>It takes the public timeline from the <a href="http://identi.ca">identica</a> microblogging service<a href="http://status.net/wiki/API">API</a> and, well, tries to animate it. Note that <em>nothing will happen until the user clicks on the default avatar icon</em>. It would have been nice if the animation didn't dump that pile of text in the lower right corner. It would be nice if the user avatars appeared to come from the default avatar and it would have been nice to make them seem like they were being "fired" at random angles. It would have been nice to use some colour, clip-paths, and gradients, maybe even animated. Aaargh!</p>
			<p>For shame:
				<object width="100%" height="100%" id="ajax" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/ajax-animation.svg">
					<img src="media/ajax-animation.png" alt="Call it abstract art" />
