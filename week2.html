	<h1>Week 2 Assignment: Creating SVG</h1>

	<p>In which Hugh Barnes hopefully fulfills course requirements for Week 2 in <em class="title course">Introduction to SVG October 2010</em>. His <a href="http://github.com/hughbris/svg-course">incremental deliberations</a> can be observed and followed on Github.</p>

	<h2>Contents</h2>
	<ol class="toc">
		<li><a href="#part1">W Gradient</a></li>
		<li><a href="#part2">The World Wide</a></li>
		<li><a href="#part3">The WoW effect</a></li>
	</ol>

	<div id="part1" class="part">
		<h2>Part 1: W Gradient</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Begin by making a picture that looks like [a depicted gradient-filled W].</p>

		<div class="response">
			<p class="response">This certainly wasn't difficult, except that I couldn't for the life of me match anything too close to the font provided. I figure <a href="week1.html#part4">that was so last week</a>:
				<object id="w" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/gradient-w.svg">
					<img src="media/gradient-w.png" alt="Letter W filled with gradient from red to green" />
				</object>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="part2" class="part">
		<h2>Part 2: The World Wide</h2>
		<p class="challenge">See next if you can do [two rotated W's leaning on each other], with a rectangle around the result.</p>
		<div class="response">
			<p>I started this exercise assuming the W's were a straight reflection, so I used the <code>translate(-1,0)</code> trick, which worked until I discovered only after starting the <a href="#part3">next part</a> that the shape was not reflected, only the gradient. Always pays to look carefully.</p>
			<p>So manual placement seemed to be in order. The angle itself was tricky. It was determined by trial and error. Incidentally, I only realised much later well into <a href="#part3">Part 3</a> why I had to also translate on the y-coordinate 20 places in my trials and multiple errors. I figure there might be a way to calculate a rotation like this with Javascript, but there seems to be an awful lot of variables.</p>
			<p>To my disappointment, the two W's were not placed correctly at work on Firefox under Windows. My <a type="image/png" href="media/gradient-ww.png">home rendering</a> is provided as the <code>object</code> element fallback.</p>
			<p>For the outline box, a scan through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/resources/svgprimer.html">Primer</a> revealed <a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/IG/resources/svgprimer.html#getBBox">a Javascript function called BBox is required</a>. The example implementation link site at the.fuchsia-design.com seems to have expired and been taken over. A little searching gave me <a href="http://my.opera.com/MacDev_ed/blog/2009/01/21/getting-boundingbox-of-svg-elements">another example</a>, which worked fine (and really I should have been able to figure it out myself, just lacking that recent Javascript confidence).</p>
			<p>Finally:
				<object id="ww" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/gradient-ww.svg">
					<img src="media/gradient-ww.png" alt="Two letters, W, tilted toward each other" />
				</object>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="part3" class="part">
		<h2>Part 3: The WoW effect</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Finally, give this [WoW effect] a try:</p>
		<p class="response">
			Behold:
			<object id="wow" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/gradient-wow.svg">
				<img src="media/gradient-wow.png" alt="WoW spelled out with gradients" />
			</object>
		</p>
