	<h1>Week 1 Assignment: Creating SVG</h1>

	<p>In which Hugh Barnes tries to fulfill course requirements for Week 1 in <em class="title course">Introduction to SVG October 2010</em>.</p>

	<div id="part1" class="part">
		<h2>Part 1</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Make a copy of the simpleRedLine.svg file discussed in the Lines and Images  lecture and embed it in your HTML page.</p>

		<p class="response">
			<object id="redline" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine.svg">
				<img src="media/simpleRedLine.png" alt="Simple Red Line" />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part2" class="part">
		<h2>Part 2</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Use different values for dash-array, stroke-width and stroke-linecap to create at least three variants of the line you created in part 1. Include these in your HTML page.</p>
		<p class="response">
			This is a pretty straightforward modification along the lines of the examples provided, using XML attributes:
			<object id="redline-A" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-A.svg">
				<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-A.png" alt="Simple red line, thicker, with dashes of magenta and rounded linecaps" />
			</object>
		</p>
		<p class="response">
			A thinner variation using blue dashing and the "square" linecaps value. This one uses inline style in the style attribute, just for fun:
			<object id="redline-B" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-B.svg">
				<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-B.png" alt="Simple red line with dashes of blue and square linecaps" />
			</object>
		</p>
		<p class="response">
			Thickest yet, with yellow dashes and butted linecaps. I used styles marked up as proper CSS within a style element near the top of the file this time. Seemed to work:
			<object id="redline-C" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-C.svg">
				<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-C.png" alt="The old simple red line, thickest yet, with dashes of yellow and butted linecaps" />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part3" class="part">
		<h2>Part 3</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Create an SVG document that looks, as much as you can make it, like the image depicted.</p>
		<p class="response">
			This seems to do the trick. I assumed the stripes were lines at first and the effect was a combination of layering and dasharray. However, as &lt;rect> elements, the fill effect can be achieved and then the only option appeared to be to create two rects appearing as one. I assumed this wasn't correct as the curve from the middle ellipse would be lost, but looking closely at the original it seems to do the same thing. In a way, this adds to the "weave" illusion. What a great task, and I hereby declare it done:
			<object id="sigourney" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/apparent-weave.svg">
				<img src="media/apparent-weave.png" alt="Tricky pattern of three ellipses with lines apparently weaved through." />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part4" class="part">
		<h2>Part 4</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Use three different browsers to experiment with the six different font families discussed in the Primer, namely: serif, garamond, arial, monospace, cursive and courier, as well as <em>two</em> additional font families of your own choosing. Display at least one SVG file showing some of your experiments and summarize your findings about cross-browser issues and fonts.</p>
		<p class="response">
			<object id="fonts" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/text-experiment.svg">
				<img src="media/text-experiment.png" alt="TODO" />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>
