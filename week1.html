	<h1>Week 1 Assignment: Creating SVG</h1>

	<p>In which Hugh Barnes tries to fulfill course requirements for Week 1 in <em class="title course">Introduction to SVG October 2010</em>. His <a href="http://github.com/hughbris/svg-course">incremental deliberations</a> can be observed and followed on Github.</p>

	<h2>Contents</h2>
	<ol class="toc">
		<li><a href="#part1">Simple red line</a></li>
		<li><a href="#part2">Line variants</a></li>
		<li><a href="#part3">Apparent weave</a></li>
		<li><a href="#part4">Text fonts</a></li>
	</ol>

	<div id="part1" class="part">
		<h2>Part 1: Simple red line</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Make a copy of the simpleRedLine.svg file discussed in the Lines and Images  lecture and embed it in your HTML page.</p>

		<p class="response">
			<object id="redline" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine.svg">
				<img src="media/simpleRedLine.png" alt="Simple Red Line" />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part2" class="part">
		<h2>Part 2: Line variants</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Use different values for dash-array, stroke-width and stroke-linecap to create at least three variants of the line you created in part 1. Include these in your HTML page.</p>
		<div class="response">
			<p>This is a pretty straightforward modification along the lines of the examples provided, using XML attributes:
				<object id="redline-A" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-A.svg">
					<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-A.png" alt="Simple red line, thicker, with dashes of magenta and rounded linecaps" />
				</object>
			</p>
			<p>A thinner variation using blue dashing and the "square" linecaps value. This one uses inline style in the style attribute, just for fun:
				<object id="redline-B" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-B.svg">
					<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-B.png" alt="Simple red line with dashes of blue and square linecaps" />
				</object>
			</p>
			<p>Thickest yet, with yellow dashes and butted linecaps. I used styles marked up as proper CSS within a style element near the top of the file this time. Seemed to work:
				<object id="redline-C" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/simpleRedLine-variant-C.svg">
					<img src="media/simpleRedLine-variant-C.png" alt="The old simple red line, thickest yet, with dashes of yellow and butted linecaps" />
				</object>
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div id="part3" class="part">
		<h2>Part 3: Apparent weave</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Create an SVG document that looks, as much as you can make it, like the image depicted.</p>
		<p class="response">
			This seems to do the trick. I assumed the stripes were lines at first and the effect was a combination of layering and dasharray. However, as <code>&lt;rect></code> elements, the fill effect can be achieved and then the only option appeared to be to create two rects appearing as one. I assumed this wasn't correct as the curve from the middle ellipse would be lost, but looking closely at the original it seems to do the same thing. In a way, this adds to the "weave" illusion. What a great task, and I hereby declare it done:
			<object height="100%" id="sigourney" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/apparent-weave.svg">
				<img src="media/apparent-weave.png" alt="Tricky pattern of three ellipses with lines apparently weaved through." />
			</object>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div id="part4" class="part">
		<h2>Part 4: Text fonts</h2>
		<p class="challenge">Use three different browsers to experiment with the six different font families discussed in the Primer, namely: serif, garamond, arial, monospace, cursive and courier, as well as <em>two</em> additional font families of your own choosing. Display at least one SVG file showing some of your experiments and summarize your findings about cross-browser issues and fonts.</p>
		<div class="response">
			<p>I preface this response by stating that web browser support is the least interesting aspect of this assignment for me, and I've been blissfully largely disinterested in fonts, well, forever. I don't really know how many of these font families are supposed to look. Even so, I understand it's important to appreciate that text fonts are poorly supported in current implementations. I think that's the point here.</p>
			<p>This is a rendering the SVG file I worked from. It's arguably overkill to use CSS to set the fonts in this case, but I did:
				<object height="100%" id="fonts" type="image/svg+xml" data="media/text-experiment.svg">
					<img src="media/text-experiment.png" alt="An experiment of text rendering with 8 font families" />
				</object>
			</p>
			<h3>Renderings</h3>
			<p>Without using closed source products, I can only easily access three desktop browsers. I have Opera Mini on my Nokia handset â€“ however, I doubt I can get a good screenshot. <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym>7 is available at work, but of course renders nothing. The screenshots shown are cropped for inclusion here, but are linked to full-size images showing full desktop context and scaling.</p>
			<div class="rendering">
				<p class="lead-in">This is how it rendered in <a href="http://www.firefox.com">Firefox</a> (3.5.12 on Fedora Linux):</p>
				<div class="screenshot">
					<a href="media/1.4-fonts-firefox.png" title="full size Firefox screenshot" type="image/png"><img src="media/1.4-fonts-firefox-cropped.png" alt="Firefox rendering of 8 fonts through SVG" /></a>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="rendering">
				<p class="lead-in"><a href="http://projects.gnome.org/epiphany/">Epiphany</a> (2.28.2 on Fedora Linux) was similar to Firefox. Wikipedia tells me <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphany_%28web_browser%29">it's no longer based on Gecko</a>, though:</p>
				<div class="screenshot">
					<a href="media/1.4-fonts-epiphany.png" title="full size Epiphany screenshot" type="image/png"><img src="media/1.4-fonts-epiphany-cropped.png" alt="Epiphany's rendering of 8 fonts through SVG" /></a>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="rendering">
				<p class="lead-in"><a href="http://www.konqueror.org">Konqueror</a> (4.4.5 on Fedora Linux) did something completely different:</p>
				<div class="screenshot">
					<a href="media/1.4-fonts-konqueror.png" title="full size Konqueror screenshot" type="image/png"><img src="media/1.4-fonts-konqueror-cropped.png" alt="Konqueror's rendering of 8 fonts through SVG" /></a>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h3>Rendering and support comments</h3>
			<p>All browsers tested supported SVG and its <code>&lt;text></code> element to some extent. Firefox rendered the same file much larger than Epiphany. Konqeror made a very small but spaced out rendering of the different text elements.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>To my eyes, Firefox and Epiphany rendered the <strong class="font">Serif</strong> font family the same as each other, but differently to Konqueror. For Serif, it appeared to me that all browsers rendered it in SVG the same as they did unstyled HTML.</li>
				<li>In <strong class="font">Garamond</strong>, only Epiphany seemed to do something different to what it did with Serif.</li>
				<li><strong class="font">Arial</strong> I think was correctly supported by Firefox and Epiphany, while Konqueror continued to render it the same as default web fonts (which may well have been Arial in a stroke of luck).</li>
				<li><strong class="font">Monospace</strong> was clearly a monospace font face of sorts on Firefox and Epiphany, but not rendered differently in Konqueror.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="font">Cursive</strong> font family was quite well spaced in Firefox and Epiphany, but rendered like Arial in Firefox and Serif in Epiphany. Konqueror did its usual default rendering. I don't think it supports text fonts in SVG.</li>
				<li><strong class="font">Courier</strong> was quite like I know it in both Firefox and Epiphany and not supported in Konqueror.</li>
				<li>A chosen additional font family, <strong class="font">Verdana</strong>, rendered in Firefox and Epiphany like each of them rendered Garamond, which was very different to each other. Konqueror failed again.</li>
				<li><strong class="font">Palatino</strong>, my next selected font, looked very similar between Firefox and Epiphany and unlike either browser had rendered any other font family in this list. Konqueror did not render it differently.</li>
			</ul>
